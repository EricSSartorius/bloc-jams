#Bloc Jams

Bloc Jams is the first web app that I created for the front-end course at [Bloc.](http://www.bloc.io)
This app was first made in JavaScript and then completely refactored into jQuery for learning purposes.
Each commit is named after a checkpoint in the course that I followed, so the evolution from JS to jQuery can be seen.

This version has since been refactored a third time in AngularJS and the repo for that can be found [here.](https://github.com/EricSSartorius/bloc-jams-angular)

###About

For my first assignment at Bloc, I was to create a simple SPA like Spotify that has the ability to play music.
Since the main focus was on functionality, the images were given to us ahead of time, only one CD (Colors) can be played, and the a mockup was pre-determined.
After setting up the landing page and collection views, most time was spent creating and setting up the album view.

Everything is fully functional and with connection to an API such as spotify, many more albums could be added to the collection view and played in the album view.

##Built With

- Grunt
- jQuery



The [AngularJS version](https://bloc-jams-angularjs.herokuapp.com/landing) of Bloc Jams has been deployed but is no longer maintained.
